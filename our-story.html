          At Students for Patient Advocacy Nationwide (SPAN), we believe the
          voices of tomorrowâ€™s healthcare leaders must be heard today.
          Founded in response to a direct threat to medical student rights, SPAN
          has grown into a powerful coalition representing students across the
          country.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          In early 2025, Texas House Bill 5294 proposed eliminating the
          pass/fail grading system at Texas medical schools, a policy that
          protects students from undue stress and preserves fair academic
          evaluation. This bill jeopardized the futures of countless medical
          students and sparked a nationwide call to action.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          SPAN quickly mobilized. We united students from institutions including
          UTMB and Baylor College of Medicine, rallying over 100 student advocates
          to directly engage with legislators and policymakers. Our coalition
          placed hundreds of calls, sent testimonies, and amplified student voices
          in the halls of government.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          Thanks to these coordinated efforts, the bill was ultimately stopped,
          preserving the pass/fail system and protecting student futures. This
          victory demonstrated the impact students can have when organized and
          empowered.
        </p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
          But SPAN is more than just one campaign. We are committed to
          democratizing healthcare policy advocacy by bridging the gap between
          students and government. Our mission is to empower young advocates to
          influence healthcare legislation at local, state, and federal levels.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
          Today, SPAN continues to grow its network, build strength in numbers,
          and champion patient-centered policies. We invite all students who
          share our passion for equitable, informed healthcare to join us and be
          part of this transformative movement.
