               At Students for Patient Advocacy Nationwide (SPAN), we believe the
               voices of tomorrowâ€™s healthcare leaders must be heard today.
               Founded in response to a direct threat to medical student rights, SPAN
               has grown into a powerful coalition representing students across the
               country.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
               In early 2025, Texas House Bill 5294 proposed eliminating the
               pass/fail grading system at Texas medical schools, a policy that
               protects students from undue stress and preserves fair academic
               evaluation. This bill jeopardized the futures of countless medical
               students and sparked a nationwide call to action.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
               SPAN quickly mobilized. We united students from institutions including
               UTMB and Baylor College of Medicine, rallying over 100 student advocates
               to directly engage with legislators and policymakers. Our coalition
               placed hundreds of calls, sent testimonies, and amplified student voices
               in the halls of government.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
               Thanks to these coordinated efforts, the bill was ultimately stopped,
               preserving the pass/fail system and protecting student futures. This
               victory demonstrated the impact students can have when organized and
               empowered.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
               But SPAN is more than just one campaign. We are committed to
               democratizing healthcare policy advocacy by bridging the gap between
               students and government. Our mission is to empower young advocates to
               influence healthcare legislation at local, state, and federal levels.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
               Today, SPAN continues to grow its network, build strength in numbers,
               and champion patient-centered policies. We invite all students who
               share our passion for equitable, informed healthcare to join us and be
               part of this transformative movement.
